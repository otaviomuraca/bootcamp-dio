## Activities

Here are some of the activities and projects I have developed during the course:

1. **[Creating a Conceptual Database Design â€“ E-COMMERCE]**

## Challenge Description
The schema must be added to a GitHub repository for future evaluation as part of the project challenge. 
Include a README file with a conceptual description of the project to provide context for your schema.

## Objective:
Refine the presented model by adding the following points:
-  Customer Type (PJ & PF) â€“ An account can either be a legal entity (PJ) or an individual (PF), but it cannot have both types of information simultaneously.
-  Payment Methods â€“ A customer can register multiple payment methods.
-  Delivery â€“ Must include status and tracking code.
-  
Now it's your turn to take the lead! Implement the suggested challenge and upload your project to your own repository.
This will further expand your portfolio and showcase your projects on GitHub! ðŸš€
