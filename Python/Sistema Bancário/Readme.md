# Simple Banking System

This is a Python program that implements a basic banking system with the following functionalities:

1. **Withdrawal**: Allows the user to make withdrawals from their account.
2. **Deposit**: Allows the user to deposit funds into their account.
3. **Account Statement**: Displays the transaction history and current balance.
4. **Exit**: Allows the user to exit the system.

The program starts with an initial balance of zero, and the maximum number of daily withdrawals is limited to 3.

To use the banking system, run the Python script and follow the instructions provided in the console.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `banking_system.py`.

2. The program will display a menu with options:
   - Type 'S' to make a withdrawal.
   - Type 'D' to make a deposit.
   - Type 'E' to view the account statement.
   - Type 'Q' to exit the system.

3. If you choose 'S' to make a withdrawal:
   - Enter the withdrawal amount.
   - The program will check if the balance is sufficient and if the daily withdrawal limit is not exceeded.
   - If the withdrawal is possible, the balance will be updated, and the transaction will be recorded.

4. If you choose 'D' to make a deposit:
   - Enter the deposit amount.
   - The deposit amount will be added to the current balance, and the transaction will be recorded.

5. If you choose 'E' to view the account statement:
   - The program will display the transaction history and the current balance.

6. If you choose 'Q' to exit the system:
   - The program will end.
